            The largest populations of Gentoo penguins are located in the Falkland Islands (South Georgia), and on the Antarctic Peninsula. \

            breedingInfo: "Gentoo penguins typically start breeding when they are 2-4 years old. \
            They build their nests on beaches or among tussocks - a small area of grass that is thicker or longer than \
            the grass growing around it. Both parents are responsible for building the nest. It is typically made from \
            pebbles or stones found around the nesting site. Sometimes the pebbles can be stolen from other nests. Females \
            lay 2 eggs which are incubated for 34 - 37 days. The parents take turns going to get food and \
            regurgitating it for their chicks; their diet can change with season and location.",

            description: "The largest, tallest, and heaviest of all the penguin species is the Emperor Penguin. This specific \
            species is the only species that breeds during the Antarctic winter. They have the deepest and longest dives \
            than any bird. They can dive to depths of 550 meters, staying underwater for 20 minutes at a time! Emperor penguins \
            are naturally well adapted to thrive in the freezing temperatures of Antarctica. They form huddles to keep warm \
            and the younger penguins tend to be in the middle, where it is much warmer. These penguins have a dense \
            double layer of feathers which helps them prevent heat loss.",

            breedingInfo: "Emperor penguins travel at least 30 miles and sometimes more than 95 miles \
            across the Antarctic to their breeding grounds. Breeding starts in May and male emperor penguins arrive before the \
            females to prepare their mating calls. These penguins are typically monogamous, staying with one mate for the \
            entire season. Females produce one egg and the male takes over to incubate it while the female goes hunting. \
            During this time, the male emperor penguin is without food for about 3 months. Female emperor penguins return once \
            their egg hatches. Baby chicks rely heavily on their parent to feed them and for warmth during the harsh \
            temperatures of the Antarctic.",

            African penguins form their colonies near Hollamsbird Island, Bird Island, and Namibia.\
            These penguins tend to live in large colonies on the rocky coastlines of Southwest Africa. These birds can swim up \
            to 12mph feeding in the water most of the day and spending their nights on the shoreline.",

            shallow burrows for their nests and both parents take turns incubating their egg(s) for up to 40 days.\
            These magnificent birds return to the same breeding site every year. Both parents feed their young for about a month \
            then they are left alone while the parents hunt for food. The baby chicks huddle together for warmth and to\
            protect themselves from predators. This is very common for most species of penguins.",
